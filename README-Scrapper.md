#### Scrapper Requires you to install the following node modules
#### using npm,
#### Please do the following in the directory where you have placed the scrapper.js

##sudo npm install request
##sudo npm install cheerio

## How to use,
#### You can use the same scrapper for other website as well.
#### But to do that , we need to make the scrapper to parse the data that we are interested.
#### Curently it doesnot support simply changing the website name.
#### But i am still developing a generic module, which works not based on DOM, but based on just search and a custom dom woth only data in it.
#### Will keep that update of scrapper in a new branch later on..
